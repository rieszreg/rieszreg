# Examples

End-to-end scripts demonstrating `rieszboost`. Two flavors:

- **Per-estimand worked examples** at the top level — one focused script per built-in factory, with the EEE / one-step plug-in estimator built around it. Read these to learn how to use a particular estimand.
- **`lee_schuler/`** — multi-estimand simulation studies that reproduce Section 4 of the paper.

## Per-estimand examples

| Built-in factory | Worked example | Highlights |
|---|---|---|
| `rieszboost.ATE()` | [`lee_schuler/binary_dgp.py`](lee_schuler/binary_dgp.py) | EEE plug-in for ATE on binary DGP |
| `rieszboost.ATT()` | [`lee_schuler/binary_dgp.py`](lee_schuler/binary_dgp.py) | Partial-parameter representer + delta-method EIF |
| `rieszboost.TSM(level=…)` | [`tsm.py`](tsm.py) | E[Y(a*)] estimator with closed-form check |
| `rieszboost.AdditiveShift(delta=…)` | [`lee_schuler/continuous_dgp.py`](lee_schuler/continuous_dgp.py) | ASE on continuous-treatment DGP |
| `rieszboost.LocalShift(delta, threshold)` | [`lee_schuler/continuous_dgp.py`](lee_schuler/continuous_dgp.py) | LASE partial-parameter + delta-method |
| `rieszboost.StochasticIntervention(samples_key=…)` | [`stochastic_intervention.py`](stochastic_intervention.py) | IPSI-style: Monte Carlo over an intervention density |

Run any of them with `.venv/bin/python examples/<script>.py --n_reps 50` (defaults are smaller for short wall time).

> **CLAUDE.md rule**: every built-in estimand factory must have a worked example here. When you add a new factory, add a runnable script demonstrating it on a realistic DGP and update this table in the same commit.

## Estimands and Riesz functionals

Two of the four estimands in Lee-Schuler are not themselves Riesz functionals — they involve the marginal `P(A=...)`, which isn't a regression nuisance. The standard pipeline (Hubbard 2011 for ATT; Susmann 2024 for LASE) fits the Riesz representer of a *partial parameter* and applies a delta-method correction downstream.

| Parameter | Riesz functional? | Riesz representer fit | Delta-method downstream |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ATE** = E[μ(1,X) − μ(0,X)] | yes — `m(O,μ) = μ(1,X) − μ(0,X)` | `α₀ = A/π − (1−A)/(1−π)` | none |
| **ATT** = E[μ(1,X) − μ(0,X) \| A=1] | **no** — equals `θ_partial / P(A=1)` | partial: `m(O,μ) = A·(μ(1,X) − μ(0,X))`. `α_partial = A − (1−A)π/(1−π)` | `ψ_ATT = ψ_partial / p̂` with EIF correction |
| **ASE** = E[μ(A+δ,X) − μ(A,X)] | yes — `m(O,μ) = μ(A+δ,X) − μ(A,X)` | `α₀ = p(A−δ\|X)/p(A\|X) − 1` | none |
| **LASE** = E[μ(A+δ,X) − μ(A,X) \| A < t] | **no** — equals `θ_partial / P(A<t)` | partial: `m(O,μ) = 1(A<t)·(μ(A+δ,X) − μ(A,X))`. `α_partial = 1(A<t+δ)·p(A−δ\|X)/p(A\|X) − 1(A<t)` | `ψ_LASE = ψ_partial / p̂_t` with EIF correction |

`rieszboost.ATT()` and `rieszboost.LocalShift(delta, threshold)` return `Estimand` objects for the *partial-parameter* m. The example scripts wrap them in `RieszBooster(estimand=...)` and build the EIF + EEE estimator inline.

## Reproducing the paper

The scripts use a single fixed hyperparameter setting plus held-out early stopping; the paper CV-tunes over a grid (`learning_rate ∈ {0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.25}`, `max_depth ∈ {3, 5, 7}`, `n_estimators ∈ {10..200}`). Without CV, our final-parameter EEE estimates land within roughly 1 SE of the paper for ATE/ATT/ASE; α-RMSE numbers are somewhat worse (factor of 1–2). Wrap a CV loop around `rieszboost.fit(...)` to close the remaining gap.

| | Paper α-RMSE | Ours α-RMSE | Paper final-param RMSE | Ours final-param RMSE |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ATE  | 0.92 | ~1.15 | 0.187 (94% cov) | ~0.20 (90% cov) |
| ATT  | 0.44 | ~0.77 | 0.177 (95% cov) | ~0.19 (98% cov) |
| ASE  | 0.37 | ~0.46 | 2.80 (93% cov) | ~3.85 (90% cov) |
| LASE | 0.25 | ~0.37 | 1.86 (95% cov) | ~4.4 (32% cov) |

LASE is the worst case — its representer has step discontinuities at `a = t` and `a = t + δ`, and tree boosting smooths them into ramps. CV-tuned hyperparameters help substantially; `max_depth ≥ 5` plus more boosting rounds is roughly the right move.

## Cross-check vs the reference implementation

`_compare_with_reference.py` runs both `rieszboost` and Kaitlyn Lee's reference fitter ([`kaitlynjlee/boosting_for_rr`](https://github.com/kaitlynjlee/boosting_for_rr)) on identical data and reports per-row α̂ disagreement. With `gradient_only=True` and `learning_rate=lr_ref/2`, our engine reproduces theirs to:

| | Pearson(ref, ours) | RMSE(ref vs ours) | RMSE vs truth (either) |
|---|---|---|---|
| ATE | 0.998 | 0.13 | ~1.0 |
| ATT | 0.986 | 0.19 | ~0.75 |

Disagreement is an order of magnitude smaller than disagreement of either implementation with the truth, so what's left is split-finding differences between sklearn `DecisionTreeRegressor` (exhaustive scan) and xgboost (histogram). The augmentation, gradient, and loss are mathematically equivalent. See [COMPARISON.md](lee_schuler/COMPARISON.md) for the math walkthrough behind the `lr_ref/2` rescaling and a separate bug we caught in the reference code.
